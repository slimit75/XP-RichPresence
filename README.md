# XP-RichPresence
Discord Rich Presence for X-Plane 11.
Based on https://github.com/leonardus/XP-RPC

**This branch is for the development of v0.9, where XP-RichPresence will be moved to its own X-Plane plugin.**

## Requirements (v0.9 and up)
- Windows 64-bit (32-bit coming later) (tested on Windows 10 1909) 
(other platforms coming later) (unsure on Mac support due to lack of mac to compile plugin on)

## How to install, configure, and more.
The wiki has now finished, and can be found [here.](https://github.com/slimit75/XP-RichPresence/wiki)
